# autoencoders
E2E AE for Comm: Jointly learns modulation + coding, hitting near‐optimal SER on AWGN channels

VAE Advantages: Probabilistic latent code → uncertainty quantification, adaptive rate control

Real-world Uses: Ultra-low-latency IoT links, dynamic spectrum sharing in 5G/6G, on-device compression

Future: ISAC Autoencoder: Design unified waveforms for simultaneous sensing & communication

Future: Online VAE Learning: Real-time channel adaptation & multi-user extensions
## Running the code:
Clone the repo and just run the radioautoencoder.py
